# 🌐 Cloned Website Projects

Welcome to my collection of cloned website projects!  
This repository contains front-end clones of popular websites created purely for learning and practice purposes.

## 🚀 About the Project

These projects were built to improve my front-end development skills, focusing on:

- Responsive layouts
- UI/UX replication
- Clean code practices
- Real-world web design patterns

Each clone is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and other tech if applicable), aiming to closely resemble the original website in design and layout.
